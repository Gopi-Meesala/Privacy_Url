# Privacy Policy for [App Name]

**Effective Date:** [October 29, 2025]

[Your Name / Your Company Name] ("we," "us," or "our") built the [App Name] app. This page is used to inform users regarding our policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of information if anyone decided to use our Service.

### 1. Information Collection and Use

**Data You Create (Locally Stored)**

This app is designed as a private, local-first utility. All workout information you enter—including logged exercises, dates, times of day, sets, reps, weight, and duration—is stored **exclusively on your device's local database**.

This data is **not** sent to any server, it is **not** collected by us, and it is **not** accessible by [Your Name / Your Company Name] or any third party. Your workout log is your own.

**Data We Do Not Collect**

We do not collect, request, or store any Personally Identifiable Information (PII) such as your name, email address, physical address, location, or phone number.

### 2. Internet Permission

The app requests Internet permission for one specific purpose:

* To download and display the animated GIF images for each exercise (from the `d205bpvrqc9yn1.cloudfront.net` domain) to provide a visual guide for your workouts.

This permission is **not** used to upload your personal data, track your activity, or for any other purpose.

### 3. Third-Party Services

This app does not use any third-party services (such as analytics, advertising, or crash reporting) that would collect or transmit data from you or your device.

### 4. Data Security

The security of your data is in your control. Since all information is stored locally on your device, it is protected by your device's built-in security measures (such as your passcode, biometrics, and device encryption). We recommend you use your device's native backup features (like Google Drive Backup) to prevent accidental data loss, as we have no way to recover your data.

### 5. Children’s Privacy

This service is not intended for use by anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any information from children under 13.

### 6. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.

These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.
